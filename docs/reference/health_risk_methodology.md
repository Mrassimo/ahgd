# Health Risk Scoring Methodology
## Australian Health Data Analytics Project

### Overview

This document outlines the methodology for developing a composite health risk scoring system that integrates socio-economic disadvantage indicators with health outcomes to identify areas requiring targeted health interventions.

### Objectives

1. **Quantify Health Risk**: Create a standardised, comparable measure of health risk across Australian SA2 areas
2. **Identify Hotspots**: Systematically identify geographic areas with elevated health risks
3. **Support Policy**: Provide evidence-based tool for resource allocation and intervention planning
4. **Enable Monitoring**: Establish baseline for tracking improvements over time

### Data Sources

#### Primary Data Sources
- **SEIFA 2021**: Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SA2 level)
  - Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD)
  - Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD)
  - Index of Economic Resources (IER)
  - Index of Education and Occupation (IEO)

- **AIHW Mortality Data**: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
  - All-cause mortality rates (age-standardised)
  - Premature mortality (deaths under 75 years)
  - Potentially avoidable deaths
  - Cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, mental health)

- **ABS Geographic Data**: Australian Bureau of Statistics
  - SA2 to SA3 correspondence files
  - Population-weighted aggregations
  - Remoteness area classifications

#### Supplementary Data Sources
- PHIDU (Public Health Information Development Unit) health indicators
- ABS Census demographic data
- Geographic boundary files for mapping

### Methodology

#### 1. Data Integration and Preparation

##### Geographic Aggregation
- **Challenge**: Health data often available at SA3/LGA level while SEIFA at SA2 level
- **Solution**: Population-weighted aggregation of SA2 SEIFA scores to SA3 level
- **Formula**: `SA3_Score = Σ(SA2_Score × SA2_Population) / Σ(SA2_Population)`

##### Data Harmonisation
- Standardise geographic identifiers across datasets
- Align temporal coverage (focus on 2018-2022 period)
- Handle missing data using appropriate imputation methods
- Age-standardise health rates for comparability

#### 2. Correlation Analysis

##### Statistical Methods
- **Pearson Correlation**: For linear relationships between continuous variables
- **Spearman Correlation**: For non-linear monotonic relationships
- **Significance Testing**: p-values calculated with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons

##### Key Relationships Examined
1. SEIFA disadvantage scores vs mortality rates
2. Socio-economic indicators vs chronic disease prevalence
3. Education/occupation indices vs preventable deaths
4. Economic resources vs life expectancy

#### 3. Health Risk Score Development

##### Component Indicators

The composite health risk score incorporates six key health indicators with differentiated weightings based on policy relevance and data quality:

| Indicator | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| All-cause mortality rate | 25% | Primary health outcome measure |
| Premature death rate (under 75) | 20% | Preventable deaths, policy priority |
| Potentially avoidable deaths | 20% | Healthcare system performance |
| Chronic disease mortality | 15% | Major disease burden |
| Mental health mortality | 10% | Growing health concern |
| Life expectancy | 10% | Overall population health |

##### Scoring Algorithm

1. **Percentile Ranking**: Each indicator converted to percentile rank (0-100)
   ```
   Percentile = (Rank / Total_Count) × 100
   ```

2. **Risk Direction Alignment**: Higher scores indicate higher risk
   - Mortality rates: Direct scoring (higher rate = higher risk)
   - Life expectancy: Reverse scoring (lower expectancy = higher risk)

3. **Weighted Composite Score**:
   ```
   Composite_Risk_Score = Σ(Indicator_Percentile × Weight)
   ```

4. **Risk Categories**: Quartile-based classification
   - **Low Risk**: 0-25th percentile
   - **Medium Risk**: 25th-50th percentile  
   - **High Risk**: 50th-75th percentile
   - **Critical Risk**: 75th-100th percentile

#### 4. Geographic Analysis

##### Spatial Clustering
- Identify geographic clusters of health risk using spatial statistics
- Analyse urban vs rural patterns
- Examine state and territory variations

##### Health Hotspot Identification
- **Definition**: Areas in top 10% of composite risk scores
- **Characteristics**: High health risk + high socio-economic disadvantage
- **Validation**: Cross-reference with known health service gaps

#### 5. Validation and Quality Assurance

##### Statistical Validation
- **Internal Consistency**: Cronbach's alpha for composite score reliability
- **Construct Validity**: Factor analysis of component indicators
- **Predictive Validity**: Correlation with independent health outcomes

##### Expert Review
- Clinical expert review of indicator selection and weights
- Public health policy expert validation of risk categories
- Geographic analysis validation by local health authorities

### Risk Score Interpretation

#### Score Ranges
- **0-25**: Low risk areas with generally good health outcomes
- **26-50**: Medium risk areas requiring monitoring
- **51-75**: High risk areas needing targeted interventions
- **76-100**: Critical risk areas requiring immediate attention

#### Policy Applications

##### Resource Allocation
- Prioritise healthcare funding based on risk scores
- Target preventive health programs to high-risk areas
- Allocate specialist services to critical risk regions

##### Performance Monitoring
- Track improvements in risk scores over time
- Evaluate intervention effectiveness
- Benchmark performance across jurisdictions

##### Strategic Planning
- Inform health service planning and infrastructure development
- Guide workforce allocation decisions
- Support evidence-based policy development

### Limitations and Considerations

#### Data Limitations
- **Temporal Lag**: Health data may have 2-3 year reporting delays
- **Geographic Mismatch**: Perfect SA2-SA3 alignment not always possible
- **Coverage Gaps**: Some health indicators not available for all areas

#### Methodological Considerations
- **Indicator Selection**: Limited by available data, may not capture all health dimensions
- **Weighting Scheme**: Based on expert judgement and literature, could be refined
- **Static Scoring**: Current approach doesn't account for trends or projections

#### Ethical Considerations
- **Stigmatisation Risk**: Avoid labelling communities negatively
- **Equity Focus**: Ensure scoring supports equity rather than reinforcing disadvantage
- **Community Engagement**: Involve communities in interpreting and acting on results

### Implementation Recommendations

#### Technical Implementation
1. **Automated Pipeline**: Develop automated data processing and scoring pipeline
2. **Regular Updates**: Update scores annually with new data releases
3. **Quality Monitoring**: Implement data quality checks and validation procedures
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive metadata and methodology documentation

#### Policy Implementation
1. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage health departments, PHNs, and local health services
2. **Training and Support**: Provide training on score interpretation and application
3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish processes for user feedback and methodology refinement
4. **Evaluation Framework**: Develop framework for evaluating policy impact of scoring system

### Future Enhancements

- Include healthcare access and quality measures
- Add real-time health surveillance data

#### Methodological Improvements
