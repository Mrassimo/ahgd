### Deployment & Documentation ✅
- [x] Deploy dashboard locally with one-click launcher (`run_dashboard.py`)
- [x] Create comprehensive project documentation (8,000+ words, user guides)
- [x] Document data sources and methodology (complete technical specification)
- [x] Prepare portfolio presentation materials (interactive showcase tools)

**Success Criteria**: ✅ EXCEEDED - Deployed interactive web application demonstrating health analytics insights
- **Results**:
  - ✅ Production-ready Streamlit dashboard operational
  - ✅ 1,200+ lines of documented Python code
  - ✅ Complete portfolio demonstration tools
  - ✅ Real-world health inequality analysis capability

## Phase 4: Code Quality & Refactoring ⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT

*Based on comprehensive codebase health audit (Grade: C+)*

### Phase 4.1: Immediate Cleanup (Week 7) - ZERO RISK
- [ ] Remove backup files (.bak, .bak2, .bak3) from scripts/ directory
- [ ] Remove .venv directory from version control (8.8MB cleanup)
- [ ] Update .gitignore to prevent future .venv inclusion
- [ ] Consolidate dependency management (remove conflicting requirements.txt)
- [ ] Consolidate database files (5 SQLite files → 1 primary database)

### Phase 4.2: Foundation Building (Week 8) - LOW RISK
- [ ] Implement configuration management system (remove hardcoded paths)
- [ ] Create config.py for centralized settings management
- [ ] Add environment variable support for deployment flexibility
- [ ] Implement basic testing framework with pytest
- [ ] Create test structure and first unit tests
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling improvements

### Phase 4.3: Structural Refactoring (Week 9-10) - MEDIUM RISK
- [ ] Decompose monolithic streamlit_dashboard.py (831 lines → modules)
  - [ ] Extract data loading functions
  - [ ] Extract visualization components  
  - [ ] Extract analysis modules
  - [ ] Create proper module imports
- [ ] Refactor health_correlation_analysis.py (681 lines → classes)
- [ ] Extract common utilities into shared modules
- [ ] Implement proper error handling patterns

### Phase 4.4: Production Readiness (Week 11-12) - HIGH VALUE
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite (target 70%+ coverage)
- [ ] Add integration tests for dashboard functionality
- [ ] Create automated API documentation generation
- [ ] Implement data versioning with DVC
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for multiple environments
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and caching

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- 🚨 Grade F: Almost zero test coverage (production blocker)
- ⚠️ Grade D+: 831-line monolithic dashboard (maintenance nightmare)  
- ⚠️ Grade C-: Hardcoded paths prevent deployment
- ⚠️ Grade C: 5 database files + binary files in git (60MB bloat)

**Success Criteria**: Upgrade codebase health from C+ to B+ (professional deployment ready)
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: 80% of identified issues resolved
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 70% with comprehensive test suite
- **Modularity**: No single file >200 lines, clear separation of concerns
- **Configuration**: Support for dev/staging/production environments
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs + architectural decisions
