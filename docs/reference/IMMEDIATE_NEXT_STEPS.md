# Immediate Next Steps for Production Readiness
## Australian Health Analytics Project

**Date:** 18 June 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Goal:** Address blocking issues for production deployment

---

## Status Update

✅ **Dependencies Fixed:** Successfully installed `folium` and `streamlit-folium`  
✅ **Basic Tests Working:** 64 tests passing in virtual environment  
❌ **Coverage Still Low:** 3.33% coverage (need 80%+)  
❌ **Deployment Not Ready:** No production deployment capability

---

## Critical Actions Required (This Week)

### 1. Fix Test Coverage (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**Current:** 3.33% | **Target:** 80%+ | **Gap:** 76.67%

#### Immediate Actions:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests to see current status
python run_tests.py --all

# Identify failing tests
python run_tests.py --all 2>&1 | grep "FAILED\|ERROR"
```

#### Test Implementation Plan:
1. **Week 1:** Fix import errors in existing tests
2. **Week 2:** Add dashboard component tests
3. **Week 3:** Add data processing tests
4. **Week 4:** Add integration tests

### 2. Create Basic Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** Not implemented | **Target:** Basic containerised deployment

#### Create Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN pip install uv
RUN uv pip install --system -e .

EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "src/dashboard/app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

#### Create docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./health_analytics.db:/app/health_analytics.db
```

### 3. Run Security Scanning (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** Not executed | **Target:** Complete security assessment

```bash
# Security scanning commands
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run bandit security scan
bandit -r src/ scripts/ -f json -o security_report.json

# Check for vulnerabilities
safety check --json > vulnerability_report.json

# Audit dependencies
pip-audit --format=json --output=audit_report.json
```

---

## Working Commands Summary

### Environment Setup:
```bash
cd /Users/massimoraso/AHGD
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Test Execution:
```bash
# Run working tests only
python run_tests.py --working

# Run all tests (will show failures)
python run_tests.py --all

# Run without coverage to see details
python run_tests.py --no-cov -v
```

### Application Launch:
```bash
# Start dashboard locally
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py

# Alternative entry points
python main.py
python run_dashboard.py
```

### Data Verification:
```bash
# Verify data integrity
python verify_data.py

# Check database
sqlite3 health_analytics.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_master;"
```

## Week 1 Detailed Plan

### Day 1-2: Fix Test Infrastructure
1. **Fix import errors** in test files
2. **Add missing test dependencies**
3. **Resolve module path issues**
4. **Achieve 50%+ coverage on core modules**

### Day 3-4: Basic Deployment
1. **Create Dockerfile** and docker-compose.yml
2. **Test containerised deployment**
3. **Document deployment process**
4. **Create staging environment**

### Day 5: Security and Documentation

## Long-term Roadmap (8-week plan)

### Weeks 1-2: Foundation
- Fix testing and achieve 80% coverage
- Create containerised deployment
- Implement basic CI/CD pipeline

### Weeks 3-4: Security and Compliance
- Implement authentication system
- Complete security hardening
- Add comprehensive audit logging

### Weeks 5-6: Production Infrastructure
- Deploy to production environment
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Create backup and recovery procedures

### Weeks 7-8: Optimisation and Certification
- Performance testing and optimisation
- Load testing and scaling
- Final production certification

---

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Skills Needed:
- **DevOps Engineering:** For deployment pipeline and infrastructure
- **Security Engineering:** For authentication and security hardening
- **Testing Engineering:** For comprehensive test suite implementation
- **Performance Engineering:** For load testing and optimisation

### Time Allocation:
- **Development:** 60% (testing, features, fixes)
- **DevOps:** 25% (deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure)
- **Security:** 10% (authentication, scanning, hardening)
- **Documentation:** 5% (procedures, runbooks, guides)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Test Coverage Gap:** May require more time than estimated
2. **Deployment Complexity:** First-time containerisation may have issues
3. **Security Implementation:** Authentication integration may be complex
4. **Performance Issues:** May discover performance bottlenecks during load testing

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Incremental Approach:** Small, testable changes
2. **External Support:** Consider consulting for specialised areas
3. **Parallel Work:** Work on multiple tracks simultaneously
4. **Regular Reviews:** Weekly progress and risk assessment
