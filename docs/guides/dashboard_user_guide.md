# Australian Health Analytics Dashboard - User Guide

## Overview

The Australian Health Analytics Dashboard is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that demonstrates correlation analysis and risk scoring between socio-economic disadvantage and health outcomes across Australia. This portfolio showcase project highlights modern data science capabilities for health policy analysis.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

4. Note statistical significance levels in the insights panel
5. Use state filtering to analyse regional patterns

**Interpretation Guide**:
- **Strong Positive Correlation (0.5 to 1.0)**: Variables increase together
- **Strong Negative Correlation (-0.5 to -1.0)**: One increases as other decreases
- **Moderate Correlation (0.3 to 0.5)**: Clear but not dominant relationship
- **Weak Correlation (0.0 to 0.3)**: Limited relationship

### 3. Health Hotspot Identification üéØ

**Purpose**: Identify priority areas for health intervention combining poor health outcomes with high socio-economic disadvantage

**Key Features**:

- **Priority Ranking**: Sorted by composite risk factors
- **Intervention Recommendations**: Risk-based priority classifications
- **Comparative Analysis**: Hotspot metrics vs national averages

**How to Use**:
1. Review the identified priority areas in the summary metrics
2. Examine individual hotspot details by expanding area cards
3. Compare hotspot averages against national benchmarks
4. Use the priority classifications to guide resource allocation
5. Export data for further policy analysis

**Priority Classifications**:
- üî¥ **Immediate Intervention Required** (Score ‚â•7/10): Critical priority areas
- üü° **Medium Priority** (Score 5-7/10): Important but less urgent
- üü¢ **Lower Priority** (Score <5/10): Monitor and maintain current services

### 4. Predictive Risk Analysis üîÆ

**Purpose**: Model health risk outcomes based on socio-economic characteristics and explore policy scenarios

**Key Features**:
- **Health Risk Prediction Tool**: Input characteristics to predict health outcomes
- **Scenario Analysis**: Model impact of socio-economic improvements
- **Population Impact Calculations**: Estimate benefiting populations
- **Interactive Parameter Controls**: Adjust multiple risk factors
- **Policy Impact Modelling**: Quantify potential intervention effects

**How to Use**:
1. **Risk Prediction**:
   - Adjust SEIFA disadvantage score slider
   - Modify population density, age profile, and healthcare access factors
   - Click "Calculate Predicted Health Risk" to see results
   - Compare predicted risk against national averages

2. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - Set improvement percentage for socio-economic conditions
   - Review projected health risk reductions
   - Assess population impact estimates
   - Use results for policy case development

**Input Parameters**:
- **SEIFA Disadvantage Score** (500-1200): Higher = less disadvantaged
- **Population Density Factor** (0.5-2.0): Urban vs rural characteristics
- **Age Profile Factor** (0.8-1.5): Population age distribution impact

- Run `verify_data.py` to check data file integrity
- Re-run data processing pipeline if necessary
- Check file permissions in data directories

### Getting Help

**For Technical Issues**:
- Check error messages displayed in the dashboard
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify system requirements and dependencies

**For Data Questions**:
