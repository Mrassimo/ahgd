**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-22  
**Next Review**: 2025-12-22  
**Classification**: Internal Use Only  

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive security guidelines for the ongoing security management of the Australian Health Geography Data (AHGD) project. These guidelines ensure consistent security practices, proactive threat management, and compliance with Australian health data security requirements.

## 1. Dependency Monitoring Procedures

### 1.1 Automated Dependency Scanning

#### Daily Automated Scans
```bash
# Schedule in CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/security.yml)
name: Daily Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM AEST
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Dependency Security Audit
        run: |
          pip install pip-audit
          pip-audit --format=json --output=security-audit.json
          pip-audit --format=table
```

#### Weekly Comprehensive Scans
- **Full dependency tree analysis** using multiple tools
- **Vulnerability database updates** before scanning
- **Cross-reference** with multiple vulnerability databases
- **Generate detailed reports** for security review

#### Tools Integration
```bash
# Primary scanning tools
pip-audit                    # Python package vulnerabilities
safety check                 # Package safety database
bandit -r src/              # Static code analysis
semgrep --config=auto src/   # SAST scanning
```

### 1.2 Vulnerability Assessment Workflow

#### Severity Classification
| Severity | Response Time | Action Required |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | 2 hours | Immediate hotfix deployment |
| **High** | 24 hours | Scheduled fix within 48 hours |
| **Medium** | 1 week | Fix in next regular release |
| **Low** | 1 month | Plan for future release |

#### Assessment Criteria
```yaml
# Vulnerability assessment matrix
assessment_criteria:
  critical:
    - Remote code execution
    - Authentication bypass
    - Data exposure (health data)
    - Privilege escalation (admin level)
  
  high:
    - Denial of service (production impact)
    - SQL injection / Code injection
    - Cross-site scripting (stored)
    - Sensitive data disclosure
  
  medium:
    - Information disclosure (non-sensitive)
    - Cross-site scripting (reflected)
    - CSRF vulnerabilities
    - Input validation bypass
  
  low:
    - Information leakage (minimal)
    - Security misconfiguration
    - Outdated dependencies (no known exploit)
```

### 1.3 Monitoring Tools and Configuration

#### GitHub Dependabot Configuration
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
      time: "02:00"
      timezone: "Australia/Sydney"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "security-team"
    labels:
      - "security"
      - "dependencies"
```

#### Security Advisory Monitoring
- **Subscribe** to security advisories for all major dependencies
- **Monitor** CVE databases for new vulnerabilities
- **Track** security-focused GitHub repositories
- **Set up alerts** for packages used in AHGD project

## 2. Regular Security Audit Schedule

### 2.1 Monthly Security Reviews

echo "AHGD Monthly Security Metrics - $(date)"
echo "=================================="

# Vulnerability counts
pip-audit --format=json | jq '.vulnerabilities | length'

# Package counts
pip list | wc -l

# Last update times
find requirements*.txt -exec stat -c "%n: %y" {} \;
