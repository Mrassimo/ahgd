## 🧪 TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

### **Phase 2.1: Schema Analysis Tests**
```python
def test_seifa_excel_structure():
    # Test real Excel file has expected sheets
    
def test_boundary_shapefile_format():
    # Test extracted shapefile has SA2 codes
    
def test_medicare_csv_columns():
    # Test CSV has expected health service columns
```

### **Phase 2.2-2.4: Processor Tests**
```python
def test_seifa_processor_real_data():
    # Test with actual downloaded SEIFA file
    
def test_boundary_conversion():
    # Test shapefile to GeoJSON conversion
    
def test_health_data_aggregation():
    # Test Medicare/PBS data processing
```

### **Phase 2.5: Integration Tests**
```python
def test_complete_pipeline():
    # Download → Process → Validate full workflow
```

## 📊 EXPECTED DISCOVERIES

Based on Phase 1 findings, Phase 2 will likely reveal:
- **SEIFA structure**: Multiple tables with different SA2 aggregations
- **Boundary complexity**: Multiple projection systems and coordinate formats
- **Health data variations**: Different time periods and service categorizations
- **Data quality issues**: Missing SA2s, encoding problems, format inconsistencies
