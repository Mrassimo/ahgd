# Automated Quality Gates
quality_thresholds = {
    'completeness_minimum': 90.0,      # Block datasets below 90%
    'uniqueness_sa2_codes': 95.0,      # Enforce geographic integrity
    'temporal_consistency': True,       # Validate date ranges
    'schema_compliance': 'strict'       # Enforce data types
}
```

```yaml
RESTful Design:
  Base URL: /api/v2/health-analytics/
  
  Endpoints:
    GET /seifa/{sa2_code}           # Socio-economic data
    GET /boundaries/{state}         # Geographic boundaries  
    GET /health/prescriptions       # PBS data
    GET /mortality/{year}/{cause}   # Death statistics
    POST /analytics/risk-score      # ML predictions
    
  Features:
    - GraphQL: Flexible queries

## 🔗 **Data Relationship Map**

### **🗝️ Primary Relationships**
```
SA2_CODE (Geographic Spine)
├─ SEIFA_2021 (2,293 areas)
├─ SA2_BOUNDARIES (2,454 areas) 
├─ PBS_HEALTH (state-level aggregation)
└─ AIHW_MORTALITY (geographic analysis)

TEMPORAL Relationships
├─ PBS_HEALTH (2016 monthly data)
├─ AIHW_MORTALITY (2019-2023 yearly)
└─ AIHW_GRIM (1907-2023 historical)
```

### **🎯 Join Opportunities**
```sql
-- Geographic Health Analysis
SELECT s.sa2_name_2021, s.irsd_score, m.crude_rate_per_100000
FROM seifa_2021 s
JOIN aihw_mortality m ON s.sa2_code_2021 = m.geography
WHERE s.irsd_decile <= 3  -- Most disadvantaged areas

-- Prescription Patterns by Disadvantage
SELECT s.irsd_decile, COUNT(p.state) as prescription_volume
FROM seifa_2021 s  
JOIN pbs_health p ON s.state_code = p.state
GROUP BY s.irsd_decile
ORDER BY s.irsd_decile
```

CREATE INDEX idx_sa2_spatial ON sa2_boundaries USING GIST(geometry);
CREATE INDEX idx_sa2_code ON seifa_2021(sa2_code_2021);
CREATE INDEX idx_temporal ON aihw_mortality(YEAR, geography);
```

#### **Memory Optimization**
```python
# Current: 67.6MB SA2 boundaries in memory
# Target: <20MB with geometry simplification
simplify_geometry_tolerance = 0.001  # 100m tolerance for web display
```
