## Data Source Limitations

### 1. Temporal Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Different data sources update at different frequencies
- AIHW health indicators: Annual updates (12-18 month lag)
- ABS census data: 5-year cycles
- BOM climate data: Real-time to monthly
- Medicare/PBS: Quarterly with 6-month lag

**Impact**: Integrated datasets may combine data from different time periods

**Workaround**: 
```bash
# Use temporal alignment feature
ahgd-transform --temporal-align nearest --reference-year 2021
```

### 2. Geographic Coverage Gaps

**Issue**: Not all datasets cover all 2,473 SA2 areas
- Remote areas often have suppressed data (privacy)
- Some health services not available in all areas
- Climate stations sparse in remote regions

**Impact**: Missing values in integrated datasets

**Current Handling**: 
- Imputation for minor gaps (<5% missing)
- Flag missing data with quality indicators
- Exclude areas with >20% missing data

### 3. Small Area Suppression

**Issue**: Australian privacy regulations require suppression of small counts
- Health data suppressed when n<5
- Some demographic data suppressed in small populations
- Service utilisation data may be aggregated to SA3 level

**Impact**: Loss of granularity in sparsely populated areas

**Mitigation**: 
```python
# Check suppression impact
from src.utils.privacy import assess_suppression_impact
impact_report = assess_suppression_impact(data)
print(f"Suppressed cells: {impact_report['suppressed_count']}")
print(f"Affected SA2s: {impact_report['affected_areas']}")
```

## Geographic Limitations

### 1. Boundary Changes

**Issue**: SA2 boundaries change between census years
- 2016 to 2021 boundary changes affect ~10% of SA2s
- Historical comparisons require correspondence tables
- Some SA2s split or merge

**Current Support**: 
- 2021 boundaries (current default)
- 2016 boundaries (with --legacy flag)
- Correspondence tables for 2016-2021 transition

**Limitation**: Pre-2016 data requires manual mapping

### 2. Coordinate Reference Systems

**Issue**: Mixed CRS usage across data sources
- Official standard: GDA2020 (EPSG:7844)
- Legacy data: GDA94 (EPSG:4283)
- Web mapping: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)

**Impact**: ~1-2 metre discrepancies if not handled correctly

**Automatic Handling**:
```python
# CRS conversion handled automatically
from src.utils.geographic_utils import standardise_crs
standardised_gdf = standardise_crs(geodataframe, target_crs='EPSG:7844')
```

### 3. Offshore Territories

**Issue**: Limited support for external territories
- Christmas Island, Cocos Islands: Limited data availability
- Norfolk Island: Partial coverage only
- Antarctic territories: Not included

**Workaround**: Focus on mainland and Tasmania only
```bash
ahgd-extract --exclude-territories external
```

## Technical Limitations

### 1. Memory Requirements

**Issue**: Full pipeline requires significant memory
- Peak usage: ~16GB for national processing
- SA2 boundary processing: ~8GB
- Climate interpolation: ~12GB

**Minimum Requirements**:
- 8GB RAM: State-level processing
- 16GB RAM: National processing
- 32GB RAM: Historical analysis (5+ years)

**Memory Optimisation**:
```bash
# Enable memory-efficient processing
export AHGD_BATCH_SIZE=100
export AHGD_MAX_WORKERS=2
ahgd-pipeline --low-memory-mode
```

### 2. Processing Time

**Issue**: Large datasets take significant time
- Full national pipeline: 2-4 hours
- Climate interpolation: 30-60 minutes
- Geographic validation: 20-40 minutes

**Performance Tips**:
```bash
# Parallel processing (requires more memory)
export AHGD_MAX_WORKERS=8

# Skip validation for development
ahgd-pipeline --skip-validation

# Process single state
ahgd-pipeline --filter-state NSW
```

### 3. Dependency Conflicts

**Issue**: Some optional dependencies may conflict
- GeoPandas vs Fiona versions
- NumPy compatibility with some statistical packages

**Solution**: Use provided environment files
```bash
# Use exact versions from lock file
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt

# Or use conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Statistical Limitations

### 1. Age Standardisation

**Issue**: Different sources use different standard populations
- AIHW: 2001 Australian standard population
- WHO indicators: World standard population
- Some sources: No standardisation

**Impact**: Direct comparison between sources may be misleading

**Recommendation**: Re-standardise using consistent population
```python
from src.utils.statistical_methods import age_standardise
standardised_rate = age_standardise(
    crude_rate, 
    age_distribution,
    standard_population='Australian_2021'
)
```

### 2. Confidence Intervals

**Issue**: Not all sources provide confidence intervals
- Generated CIs assume normal distribution
- Small areas may have wide intervals
- Composite indicators lack proper CIs

**Limitation**: Statistical significance testing limited

### 3. Ecological Fallacy

**Issue**: SA2-level data cannot infer individual-level relationships
- Aggregated data masks within-area variation
- Correlation â‰  causation at area level
- Simpson's paradox may occur

**Important**: Always acknowledge ecological nature of analyses

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Large File Handling

**Issue**: Some outputs can be very large
- National GeoJSON: >500MB
- Full time series: >2GB per year
- Uncompressed CSV: >1GB

**Recommendations**:
```bash
# Use compressed formats
ahgd-loader --format parquet --compress snappy

# Partition large datasets
ahgd-loader --partition-by state,year

# Stream processing for large files
ahgd-transform --streaming-mode
```

### 2. Network Limitations

**Issue**: Data downloads can be slow/fail
- AIHW rate limits: 100 requests/minute
- Large files may timeout
- Network interruptions cause failures

**Built-in Handling**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Resume capability for large downloads
- Local caching of downloaded data

### 3. Disk Space

**Issue**: Full pipeline requires substantial disk space
- Raw data: ~10GB
- Processed data: ~15GB
- Temporary files: ~20GB during processing

**Space Saving**:
```bash
# Clean temporary files
ahgd-pipeline --clean-temp

# Remove raw data after processing
ahgd-pipeline --no-keep-raw

# Use compression
ahgd-loader --compress-all
```

## Known Bugs

### 1. Loguru Timestamp Error

**Status**: Non-critical
**Version**: All versions
**Issue**: `KeyError: '"timestamp"'` in logs
**Impact**: Cosmetic only - doesn't affect data processing
**Workaround**: Ignore or disable formatted logging
```bash
export AHGD_SIMPLE_LOGS=true
```

### 2. Memory Leak in Climate Interpolation

**Status**: Under investigation
**Version**: <1.2.0
**Issue**: Memory usage grows with large climate datasets
**Impact**: May cause OOM errors for national processing
**Workaround**: Process in state batches
```bash
for state in NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT; do
    ahgd-transform --filter-state $state --dataset climate
done
```

### 3. SA2 Name Encoding

**Status**: Fixed in v1.2.1
**Issue**: Special characters in SA2 names cause encoding errors
**Impact**: CSV export may fail for certain areas
**Solution**: Update to latest version or use UTF-8 encoding
```bash
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
```

## Workarounds and Solutions

### Handling Missing Data

```python
# Option 1: Imputation
from src.utils.imputation import smart_impute
imputed_df = smart_impute(df, method='spatial_average')

# Option 2: Exclusion
complete_df = df.dropna(subset=['critical_field'])

# Option 3: Flag and retain
df['missing_flag'] = df['value'].isna()
```

### Temporal Alignment

```python
# Align multiple datasets to common year
from src.utils.temporal import align_temporal
aligned_data = align_temporal(
    datasets=[health_df, census_df, climate_df],
    target_year=2021,
    method='nearest'  # or 'interpolate'
)
```

### Geographic Matching

```python
# Fuzzy matching for inconsistent SA2 names
from src.utils.geographic_matching import fuzzy_match_sa2
matched_df = fuzzy_match_sa2(
    df, 
    sa2_column='area_name',
    threshold=0.9
)
```
