## Report Generation

Most reports are generated automatically through:

- Data processing pipelines
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD processes
- Manual analysis scripts

## Using Reports

### For Developers
- Review testing reports before making changes
- Check coverage reports to identify untested code
- Use health reports to maintain code quality

### For Project Managers
- Review analysis reports for project status
- Use deployment reports for production planning
- Monitor health reports for technical debt

### For Stakeholders
- Analysis reports provide insights into data capabilities
- Deployment reports show production readiness
- Testing reports demonstrate quality assurance

## Report Maintenance

Reports should be:
- Regenerated after significant changes
- Archived when superseded by newer versions
- Linked from relevant documentation
- Updated to reflect current system state
