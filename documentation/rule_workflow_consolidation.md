# Rule and Workflow File Consolidation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to consolidate and clarify rule and workflow files in the AHGD ETL project. The goal was to establish clear boundaries between project standards, tool-specific configurations, and user-specific settings.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md

Added a detailed `CONTRIBUTING.md` file at the project root that defines:
- Project structure and organization standards
- Development workflow and guidelines
- Code standards and patterns
- Testing requirements
- Configuration standards
- Documentation requirements

### 2. Established Configuration Guide

Created `documentation/configuration_guide.md` which clarifies:
- Different types of configuration (project, data model, environment, tool, user)
- Location and purpose of each configuration file
- Best practices for working with configurations
- How to add new configurations
- How to access configurations through the settings API

### 3. Organized Tool Configurations

Created `docs/tooling/` directory to store templates and documentation for tool-specific configurations:
- Added README.md explaining purpose and usage
- Added templates for common tools:
  - Claude MCP configuration (`.claudemcpconfig`)
  - Task Master configuration (`.taskmasterconfig`)
  - WindSurf rules (`.windsurfrules`)
  - VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)

### 4. Standardized Environment Variables

- Created `.env.example` as a template for environment variables
- Added documentation for environment variables
- Ensured all sensitive/user-specific files are in `.gitignore`

### 5. Updated README.md

Updated the main `README.md` to reflect:
- New project structure
- Enhanced configuration system
- Reference to CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines
- Updated running instructions for the enhanced ETL pipeline

### 6. Clarified gitignore Categories

Enhanced `.gitignore` with clear sections for:
- Python-specific files
- Testing and coverage files
- Virtual environments
- IDE-specific files
- OS-specific files
- Project data files
- External tool configurations
- Environment variables
- Local user configurations

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Standards**: Developers now have a single source of truth for project standards in CONTRIBUTING.md
2. **Consistent Configurations**: Templates and documentation ensure consistency across environments
3. **Better Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand how configuration works
4. **Reduced Repository Bloat**: Better .gitignore practices prevent unnecessary files in the repository
5. **Tool Documentation**: Developers can understand which tools are used and how they are configured
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between project standards, tool configurations, and user preferences

## Next Steps

1. Review and update the YAML configuration files as the project evolves
2. Consider adding script to generate initial configurations from templates
3. Add validation for configuration files to catch errors early
4. Update documentation as new tools or standards are introduced
5. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to verify configurations
