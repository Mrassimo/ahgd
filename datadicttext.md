Okay, mate, let's craft a data dictionary that's the "bee's knees" for an Australian private health insurer (PHI), based on the data sources discussed (ABS Geo, Census) but designed with a PHI's analytical needs in mind.

This dictionary goes beyond just the currently implemented geo_dimension and population_dimension. It anticipates the full scope suggested by your project files, aiming for a robust dimensional model (star schema) suitable for business intelligence and data science within a PHI.

We'll use surrogate keys (_sk) for dimensions, which are best practice for data warehousing, and clearly link them in the fact tables.

AHGD Data Dictionary - PHI Enhanced Version

Philosophy: This model integrates ABS geographic, demographic, and health data into a structure optimised for analysis relevant to a Private Health Insurer. It enables understanding of population characteristics, health needs, socioeconomic factors, and their geographic distribution, supporting market analysis, risk assessment, product development, and targeted interventions.

Target Format: Parquet files (suitable for Polars, DuckDB, Spark, etc.)

Dimension Tables

These tables describe the "who, what, where, when" of the data.
