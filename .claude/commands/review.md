AI Codebase Health Check & Refactoring Plan

Objective

To perform a comprehensive audit of the AI project's codebase, environment, and documentation. The outcome will be a single, actionable report (CODEBASE_HEALTH_REPORT.md) that identifies key areas of technical debt and provides a prioritized refactoring plan to improve reproducibility, maintainability, and scalability.
1. Audit and Analysis Phase
1.1. Reproducibility & Environment

    Dependency Analysis:
        Examine requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, environment.yml, or similar files.
        Verify that dependencies are pinned with specific versions (e.g., pandas==2.1.0) rather than open-ended ranges (pandas>=2.0).
        Flag any dependencies checked directly into version control.
    Data Versioning:
        Investigate how datasets are managed. Are they referenced by filename (e.g., data_final_v3.csv), or is a formal data versioning tool (like DVC) in use?
        Check if there is a clear process for updating or adding new data.
    Secrets Management:
        Scan the codebase for hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other credentials.
        Verify if a .env file, environment variables, or a dedicated secrets manager is being used.

1.2. Code Structure & Modularity

    Notebook-to-Script Conversion:
        Identify core logic living inside Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb).
        Determine which notebooks are for one-off analysis vs. those containing reusable logic for training or inference pipelines.
    Modularity and Separation of Concerns:
        Analyze Python scripts (.py). Are they monolithic (e.g., a single 2000-line main.py)?
        Assess if there is a clear separation between:
            Data loading/processing logic.
            Model definition/architecture.
            Training loops.
            Inference/prediction functions.
            Utility functions.
    Code Duplication:
        Scan for duplicated blocks of code across different scripts or notebooks.
        Pay special attention to repeated data cleaning steps or evaluation metrics calculations.

1.3. Configuration Management

    Hardcoded Parameters:
        Identify "magic numbers" and strings directly in the code. This includes file paths, model hyperparameters (learning_rate, batch_size), and thresholds.
    Configuration Files:
        Check for the existence and use of configuration files (e.g., config.yaml, settings.py).
        Evaluate if the configuration is comprehensive or if key parameters are still hardcoded.

1.4. Testing & Validation

    Test Existence and Coverage:
        Look for a /tests directory and test files using frameworks like pytest or unittest.
        Assess what is being tested. Are there tests for data processing functions? Utility functions? Is there any testing for the model's expected output shape or type?
    Test Quality:
        Review if tests are trivial (e.g., assert True) or if they meaningfully validate the code's behavior with realistic inputs.

1.5. Documentation & Discoverability

    The README File:
        Review the root README.md. Does it clearly state the project's purpose? Does it explain how to set up the environment and run the primary scripts (train, predict)?
    Docstrings and Comments:
        Examine critical functions and classes. Do they have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values?
        Is the code commented in a way that explains the "why," not just the "what"?
    Model Documentation:
        Check for a "Model Card" or equivalent document that describes the model's intended use, performance metrics, biases, and limitations.

2. Synthesis and Reporting Phase
2.1. Generate the Health Report

    Create a new file: CODEBASE_HEALTH_REPORT.md.
    Populate the report using the template below, filling it with the findings from the Audit Phase.
    Provide an overall "Health Score" for each category to help prioritize work.
    For each identified issue, create a specific, actionable recommendation in the "Refactoring Backlog" section.

2.2. Prioritize the Backlog

    Review the list of refactoring tasks.
    Assign a priority (High, Medium, Low) to each task based on its estimated impact and effort. For example, fixing hardcoded secrets is High impact, low effort. Refactoring a monolithic script is High impact, high effort.
    Provide a recommendation on where the team should start.

Guidelines

    AUDIT, DON'T FIX: The goal of this command is to produce a plan, not to execute it. Resist the urge to refactor code during the analysis phase.
    BE OBJECTIVE: Base findings on evidence found in the codebase, not on assumptions.
    PRIORITIZE RUTHLESSLY: Acknowledge that not everything can be fixed at once. Focus the plan on the changes that will provide the most value in terms of stability and developer velocity.

# AI Codebase Health Report

- **Date of Audit:** 2025-06-17
- **Auditor:** [Your Name/Team]

---

## 1. Executive Summary

A brief, one-paragraph summary of the codebase's overall health. Highlight the biggest strengths and the most critical areas for improvement.

---

## 2. Health Scorecard

| Category | Grade (A-F) | Key Observations |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Reproducibility & Env** | C | Dependencies are not pinned, making builds unreliable. Data is not versioned. |
| **Code Structure** | D | Core training logic is in a 1500-line notebook. No clear separation of concerns. |
| **Configuration** | C | Hyperparameters are hardcoded across multiple files. |
| **Testing** | F | No formal tests exist. |
| **Documentation** | D | README is missing setup instructions. No model card. |

## 3. Key Issues and Recommendations

### 3.1. High Priority Issues
* **Issue:** Lack of Pinned Dependencies
    * **Risk:** Builds can fail unexpectedly when a sub-dependency is updated. Results are not reproducible.
    * **Recommendation:** Generate a `requirements.txt` file with pinned versions using `pip freeze` and commit it.
* **Issue:** Hardcoded Secrets in `main.py`
    * **Risk:** Critical security vulnerability.
    * **Recommendation:** Remove secrets from source code immediately and implement loading from environment variables using `python-dotenv`.

### 3.2. Medium Priority Issues
* **Issue:** Monolithic Training Notebook
    * **Risk:** Code is difficult to debug, reuse, and test.
    * **Recommendation:** Refactor the notebook into separate Python scripts: `src/data_processing.py`, `src/model.py`, `src/train.py`.
