# Australian Health Data Analytics - Project To-Do

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Python 3.11+ and UV package manager
- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Set up Git repository
- [ ] Install core dependencies (Polars, DuckDB, GeoPandas)

### First Data Pipeline
- [ ] Download ABS Census 2021 SA2 data for target state
- [ ] Download SEIFA 2021 socio-economic indexes
- [ ] Download SA2 geographic boundaries (shapefiles)
- [ ] Create basic data loading scripts with Polars
- [ ] Set up DuckDB workspace

### Geographic Foundation
- [ ] Load and visualise SA2 boundaries
- [ ] Create demographic profiles by SA2
- [ ] Build socio-economic disadvantage mapping
- [ ] Validate geographic framework understanding

**Success Criteria**: Interactive map showing demographics and SEIFA scores for local region

## Phase 2: Health Data Integration (Week 3-4)

### Health Data Sources
- [ ] Download MBS statistics from data.gov.au
- [ ] Download PBS prescription data
- [ ] Access AIHW health indicator reports
- [ ] Create postcode-to-SA2 concordance mapping

### Data Processing
- [ ] Build health service utilisation metrics
- [ ] Map health indicators to geographic areas
- [ ] Create population-weighted health statistics
- [ ] Develop basic health risk scoring algorithm

### Analysis Development
- [ ] Calculate health vs socio-economic correlations
- [ ] Identify health service access patterns
- [ ] Build area-based health risk profiles
- [ ] Validate data quality and completeness

**Success Criteria**: Health metrics successfully mapped to SA2 geography with clear patterns visible

## Phase 3: Analytics & Dashboard (Week 5-6)

### Interactive Dashboard
- [ ] Set up Streamlit application framework
- [ ] Create interactive geographic mapping with Folium
- [ ] Build health metric selection and filtering
- [ ] Implement area comparison tools

### Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Develop "health hotspot" identification algorithm
- [ ] Create provider access analysis using distance calculations
- [ ] Integrate environmental risk factors (air quality data)
- [ ] Build predictive health risk models

### Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Deploy dashboard to Streamlit Cloud or GitHub Pages
- [ ] Create project documentation and README
- [ ] Document data sources and methodology
- [ ] Prepare portfolio presentation materials

**Success Criteria**: Deployed interactive web application demonstrating health analytics insights
