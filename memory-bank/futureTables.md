# Future Census Tables for Implementation
This document contains information about future ABS Census tables that could be implemented in our ETL pipeline, based on analysis of the ABS metadata files.

## Health-Related Tables

### G20: G20 COUNT OF SELECTED LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS(a) BY AGE BY SEX

This table contains data about health conditions across the population. It follows ABS's standard structure for Census tables:

- Contains data broken down by age groups and sex
- Includes totals for each category
- Uses standard ABS column naming conventions

**Implementation Notes:**

1. Like G17, G18, and G19, column names may have inconsistencies and typos
2. The data may be split across multiple files (e.g., G20A, G20B) if it contains many columns
3. Implement using the flexible column mapping pattern established for G18 and G19
4. Follow the standardized output naming convention: `g{table_id}_{gender}_{characteristic}_{age_group}`

**Potential Applications:**

- Analysis of health condition prevalence across different demographics
- Correlation of health conditions with other socioeconomic factors
- Health service planning based on condition prevalence

### G21: G21 TYPE OF LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITION(a) BY SELECTED PERSON CHARACTERISTICS

This table contains data about health conditions across the population. It follows ABS's standard structure for Census tables:

- Contains data broken down by age groups and sex
- Includes totals for each category
- Uses standard ABS column naming conventions

**Implementation Notes:**

1. Like G17, G18, and G19, column names may have inconsistencies and typos
2. The data may be split across multiple files (e.g., G20A, G20B) if it contains many columns
3. Implement using the flexible column mapping pattern established for G18 and G19
4. Follow the standardized output naming convention: `g{table_id}_{gender}_{characteristic}_{age_group}`

**Potential Applications:**

- Analysis of health condition prevalence across different demographics
- Correlation of health conditions with other socioeconomic factors
- Health service planning based on condition prevalence

### G23: G23 VOLUNTARY WORK FOR AN ORGANISATION OR GROUP BY AGE BY SEX 

This table contains data about voluntary work participation. It follows ABS's standard structure for Census tables:

- Contains data broken down by age groups and sex
- Includes totals for each category
- Uses standard ABS column naming conventions

**Implementation Notes:**

1. Like G17, G18, and G19, column names may have inconsistencies and typos
2. The data may be split across multiple files (e.g., G20A, G20B) if it contains many columns
3. Implement using the flexible column mapping pattern established for G18 and G19
4. Follow the standardized output naming convention: `g{table_id}_{gender}_{characteristic}_{age_group}`

**Potential Applications:**

- Analysis of volunteer demographics and distribution
- Correlation between volunteering and health outcomes
- Community engagement assessment

### G25: G25 UNPAID ASSISTANCE TO A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY, HEALTH CONDITION OR DUE TO OLD AGE, BY AGE BY SEX 

This table contains data about health conditions across the population. It follows ABS's standard structure for Census tables:

- Contains data broken down by age groups and sex
- Includes totals for each category
- Uses standard ABS column naming conventions

**Implementation Notes:**

1. Like G17, G18, and G19, column names may have inconsistencies and typos
2. The data may be split across multiple files (e.g., G20A, G20B) if it contains many columns
3. Implement using the flexible column mapping pattern established for G18 and G19
4. Follow the standardized output naming convention: `g{table_id}_{gender}_{characteristic}_{age_group}`

**Potential Applications:**

- Analysis of health condition prevalence across different demographics
- Correlation of health conditions with other socioeconomic factors
- Health service planning based on condition prevalence

### G46: G46 LABOUR FORCE STATUS BY AGE BY SEX

This table contains data about employment status. It follows ABS's standard structure for Census tables:

- Contains data broken down by age groups and sex
- Includes totals for each category
- Uses standard ABS column naming conventions

**Implementation Notes:**

1. Like G17, G18, and G19, column names may have inconsistencies and typos
2. The data may be split across multiple files (e.g., G20A, G20B) if it contains many columns
3. Implement using the flexible column mapping pattern established for G18 and G19
4. Follow the standardized output naming convention: `g{table_id}_{gender}_{characteristic}_{age_group}`

**Potential Applications:**

- Correlation between employment status and health outcomes
- Economic analysis of health-related employment patterns
- Identification of at-risk populations based on employment status

---

### G49: G49 HIGHEST NON-SCHOOL QUALIFICATION: LEVEL OF EDUCATION(a) BY AGE BY SEX

This table contains data about education levels. It follows ABS's standard structure for Census tables:

- Contains data broken down by age groups and sex
- Includes totals for each category
- Uses standard ABS column naming conventions

**Implementation Notes:**

1. Like G17, G18, and G19, column names may have inconsistencies and typos
2. The data may be split across multiple files (e.g., G20A, G20B) if it contains many columns
3. Implement using the flexible column mapping pattern established for G18 and G19
4. Follow the standardized output naming convention: `g{table_id}_{gender}_{characteristic}_{age_group}`

**Potential Applications:**

- Correlation between education levels and health outcomes
- Analysis of healthcare workforce qualifications
- Targeting health education programs

## Implementation Strategy

When implementing these tables, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Start with G20 and G21**: These tables directly extend our existing health condition data (G19)
2. **Implement G25 next**: Unpaid care assistance is closely related to health conditions
3. **Add G23**: Volunteer work can provide context for community health support
4. **Follow with G46 and G49**: Employment and education status provide socioeconomic context

For each implementation:

1. Add the table pattern to `config.py`
2. Create a dedicated processing module (`process_g##.py`)
3. Implement flexible column mapping like in G18 and G19
4. Create comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation
