## Recent Achievements

- Successfully added geographic centroids (longitude/latitude) to all boundary levels with proper CRS projections
- Completed G18 processing with 1.4M rows of assistance needed data
- Enhanced G19 processing handling 7.4M rows of health condition data
- Improved G21 implementation processing 11.9M rows with proper characteristic parsing
- Optimised G25 processing achieving 99.97% geographic match rate on 1.5M rows
- Fixed critical issues in G18 and G19 Census table processing by implementing robust column name pattern recognition
- Enhanced `filter_special_geo_codes` utility function to remove dependency on regex backreferences
- Fixed performance bottleneck in `run_census_g25_processing` by replacing row-by-row filtering with vectorised operations
- Improved logging configuration to eliminate duplicate timestamps and module names
- Implemented proper temporary file cleanup using try-finally blocks for reliability
- Removed unused legacy code to reduce maintenance overhead
- Improved code readability by breaking up long lines and standardising formatting
- Updated codebase to use Australian English spelling consistently
- Migrated project to a new directory structure with clear separation of data files and code
- Created two main directories: 'data_files' for input/output data and 'app' for code and documentation
- Preserved project-related documentation for reference and future development
- Completed refactoring of all process_gXX_file functions to use the standardised _process_single_census_csv helper
- Updated process_census_table to directly use process_file_function instead of the legacy helper
- Improved parameter naming consistency and reduced code duplication across all Census processing functions
- Implemented generic process_gXX_file pattern to reduce code duplication
- Improved staging file handling for G20 and G21 tables to use temporary directories and cleanup
- Enhanced metadata extraction tool for all census tables to better understand data structures
- Fixed G17 and G18 processing to handle multiple column naming patterns
- Created test scripts and sample data generators to validate processing functions
- Improved geographic code detection across different file formats and levels
- Completed G21 processing with dimension integration
- Implemented G25 processing for unpaid assistance data
- Created backup archive of older data files
- Identified need for comprehensive data validation framework

## Outstanding Issues

1. Need comprehensive data validation framework
2. Cross-table consistency checks required
3. Documentation updates needed for validation framework
4. Performance optimization for large datasets

## Next Milestones

1. Design and implement data validation framework
2. Create validation rules based on data dictionary
3. Implement cross-table consistency checks
4. Develop automated validation reporting
5. Set up quality metric thresholds and alerts

## Development Environment

- Python 3.9+
- Polars for data processing
- SQLite for local testing
- PostgreSQL for production database
- pytest for test framework
- Data validation framework (to be implemented)

## Project Structure

New clean project structure:
- `/data_files/` - Contains all input and output data
  - `/data_files/raw/` - For input raw census data files
  - `/data_files/output/` - For processed output files (fact and dimension tables)
- `/app/` - Contains all code and documentation
  - `/app/etl_logic/` - Core ETL processing modules
  - `/app/scripts/` - Utility scripts for download, analysis, etc.
  - `/app/tests/` - Test suite
  - `/app/documentation/` - Project documentation
  - `/app/logs/` - Log files
  - `/app/src/` - Source modules
