## Project Handover: AHGD ETL Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-03-31 (Based on file modification times)

**Project Goal:** To Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) geographic boundary data (ASGS) and Census General Community Profile (GCP) data into a structured dimensional model (star schema) stored in Parquet format. The goal is to create a queryable data warehouse suitable for healthcare planning, demographic analysis, and related research.

**Target Data Sources:**
*   ABS ASGS 2021 Digital Boundary Files (Shapefiles for SA1, SA2, SA3, SA4, STE, POA)
*   ABS Census 2021 General Community Profile (GCP) DataPacks (specifically tables G01, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21, G25 initially)

**Target Output:** A set of dimension and fact tables stored as Parquet files in the `output/` directory, forming a star schema.

**Technology Stack:**
*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Core Processing:** Polars
*   **Geospatial:** GeoPandas, Shapely
*   **Utilities:** Pandas (some utility/legacy), Requests, python-dotenv, zipfile
*   **Testing:** pytest, pytest-mock
*   **Configuration:** Python modules (`config.py`) and `.env` file
*   **Environment:** Designed to run locally and potentially in Google Colab (specific notebooks provided).

### 1. Project Structure Overview

*   **`etl_logic/`:** Contains the core Python modules for the ETL process.
    *   `config.py`: Central configuration (paths, URLs, column mappings, schemas). *Needs completion.*
    *   `utils.py`: Helper functions (logging, download, extraction, data cleaning).
    *   `geography.py`: Processes ASGS shapefiles into `geo_dimension.parquet`. Includes centroid calculation.
    *   `census.py`: Generic functions for finding, extracting, and processing Census CSV files (e.g., `process_census_table`, `_process_single_census_csv`, specific unpivot functions). Also contains legacy/moved table-specific processors that need cleanup.
    *   `dimensions.py`: Functions to create dimension tables (`dim_health_condition`, `dim_demographic`, `dim_person_characteristic`).
    *   `time_dimension.py`: Generates the `dim_time.parquet` table.
    *   `validation.py`: Functions for data quality checks (counts, nulls, ranges, uniqueness, referential integrity).
    *   `tables/`: Contains modules with specific processing logic for individual Census tables (e.g., `g01_population.py`, `g25_unpaid_assistance.py`). *This is the recommended location for table-specific logic.*
*   **`scripts/`:** Utility and analysis scripts.
    *   `analysis/`: Scripts for exploring metadata and data structures (e.g., `extract_g21_metadata.py`). *Need review for integration/cleanup.*

    *   Others: Scripts for generating profiling reports, extracting schemas, etc.
*   **`tests/`:** Contains unit and integration tests using `pytest`.
*   **`output/`:** Default location for generated Parquet dimension and fact tables, profiling reports, and schema diagrams.
*   **`data/`:** Intended location for raw data files (managed via `.gitignore`).
*   **`logs/`:** Location for ETL execution logs.
*   **`documentation/`:** Contains project planning docs, data dictionary (`datadicttext.md`), and diagrams.
*   `run_etl.py`: Main command-line interface script to orchestrate the ETL pipeline steps.
*   `config.py`: (Root level) Main configuration entry point, imports from `etl_logic.config`.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python package dependencies.
*   `setup.py`: Basic package setup for `etl_logic`.
*   `.env`: Environment variables (e.g., `BASE_DIR`).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files/directories excluded from Git.
*   `colab_runner.ipynb`, `ahgd_etl_notebook.py`: Alternative execution environments for Google Colab.

### 2. Current Status ("Where I'm up to")

*   **Working Components:**
    *   Data download and extraction from ZIP files seems functional.
    *   Geographic processing (`geography.py`) creates `geo_dimension.parquet` including centroids.
    *   Time dimension generation (`time_dimension.py`) creates `dim_time.parquet`.
    *   Basic processing frameworks exist for Census tables G01, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21, G25. Many include specific parsing/unpivoting logic.
    *   Stub dimension tables (`dim_health_condition`, `dim_demographic`, `dim_person_characteristic`) are generated.
    *   Orchestration script (`run_etl.py`) allows running specific steps or all steps.
    *   Logging is implemented.
    *   Configuration is partially centralized (`config.py` and `.env`).
    *   A testing suite (`pytest`) is set up with tests covering utilities, config, geo, time, some census processors, dimensions, and validation.
    *   Data validation (`validation.py`) checks for counts, nulls, ranges, key uniqueness, and referential integrity.
    *   Surrogate key verification script exists.
    *   Basic data profiling/schema extraction scripts are present.
*   **Key Areas Requiring Attention (based on `apply.md` and validation outputs):**
    *   **Validation Failures:** The validation step (`run_etl.py --steps validate`) and `verify_surrogate_keys.py` indicate significant issues:
        *   **Duplicate Keys:** Found in `fact_health_conditions_refined.parquet` (check composite key uniqueness: `geo_sk`, `time_sk`, `condition_sk`, `demographic_sk`).
        *   **Null Foreign Keys:** `time_sk` is NULL in `fact_no_assistance.parquet`. Other FKs might have issues.
        *   **Referential Integrity:** Foreign keys in fact tables are not consistently found in their corresponding dimension tables (e.g., `fact_health_conditions_refined` vs dimensions). This points to issues with either surrogate key generation in dimensions or the join logic when creating refined facts.
    *   **Configuration (`config.py`):** Needs to be fully populated, especially `CENSUS_COLUMN_MAPPINGS` (consolidating examples from `census.py`) and `SCHEMAS` for all output tables. Ensure no hardcoded paths remain (check `scripts/`).
    *   **Code Structure/Refactoring:** Table-specific processing logic needs to be fully moved from `census.py` to respective `etl_logic/tables/gXX_*.py` files. Review the utility of `_process_single_census_csv` for complex tables vs. handling logic within the table-specific processors. Potentially generalize parsing logic in `utils.py`.
    *   **Dimension Generation (`dimensions.py`):** Review surrogate key generation for stability and correctness. Ensure dimensions contain all necessary codes/values needed by fact tables *before* facts are processed/joined. Address potential schema drift (e.g., `dim_health_condition` missing `condition_sk`).
    *   **Orchestration (`run_etl.py`):** Could be made more robust (data-driven steps, better error reporting).
    *   **Testing:** While tests exist, coverage needs improvement, particularly for the detailed parsing/transformation logic within each `process_gXX_file` function and integration tests for the fact table refinement process (joining with dimensions). Add tests for `validation.py`.
    *   **Documentation:** Needs updates to reflect the final structure and fix inconsistencies.
    *   **Colab Notebooks:** Need review to ensure they align with the refactored codebase.

### 3. Next Steps (Action Plan)

Based on the current status and the `apply.md` checklist, here are the recommended next steps in approximate priority order:

1.  **Fix Validation Failures (Highest Priority):**
    *   Debug and fix the root cause of duplicate keys in `fact_health_conditions_refined.parquet`. Review the grain and join logic.
    *   Investigate and fix why `time_sk` is null in `fact_no_assistance.parquet`. Trace the `time_sk` propagation through `process_census_table` for G25.
    *   Resolve all referential integrity (FK) errors identified by `validation.py` and `verify_surrogate_keys.py`. This likely involves:
        *   Ensuring dimension tables (`dim_health_condition`, `dim_demographic`, `dim_person_characteristic`) are generated *before* the refined fact tables that need them.
        *   Correcting surrogate key generation in dimensions if needed.
        *   Ensuring the join logic correctly links fact data to dimension keys.
    *   Address the schema drift for `dim_health_condition` (ensure `condition_sk` is present and correctly named).

2.  **Complete Configuration (`config.py`):**
    *   Consolidate and complete `CENSUS_COLUMN_MAPPINGS` for all G-tables being processed.
    *   Define `SCHEMAS` in `config.py` for all target dimension and fact tables using Polars dtypes. Enforce these schemas on output.
    *   Remove any remaining hardcoded paths (especially in `scripts/`).

3.  **Refactor Code Structure:**
    *   Move all remaining `process_gXX_file` logic from `census.py` to `etl_logic/tables/`.
    *   Update `run_etl.py` imports to use the functions from `etl_logic.tables.`.
    *   Refine the generic helpers in `census.py` and potentially move generic parsing logic to `utils.py`.

4.  **Refactor Orchestration (`run_etl.py`):**
    *   Consider making the step execution more data-driven (e.g., using a list/dict defining steps and their functions).
    *   Improve error handling and provide a clear summary report at the end.
    *   Ensure the `validate` step runs reliably at the end of a full run and its status affects the final outcome.

5.  **Enhance Testing:**
    *   Write specific unit tests for each `process_gXX_file` function in `etl_logic/tables/`, covering various column name permutations and edge cases.
    *   Add integration tests for `process_census_table` to verify file finding, extraction, processing, combining, and dimension joining logic.
    *   Add tests for the `validation.py` functions themselves.
    *   Use `pytest-cov` to measure and improve test coverage.

6.  **Review Analysis Scripts:** Decide whether scripts in `scripts/analysis/` should be integrated into the ETL, kept as separate tools (cleaned up), or removed. Ensure they use `config.py`.

7.  **Update Documentation:**
    *   Revise `README.md` to accurately reflect the current structure, steps, and outputs.
    *   Update `datadicttext.md` to match the final schemas defined in `config.py`.
    *   Add docstrings to functions and classes.

8.  **Review Colab Environment:** Ensure `colab_runner.ipynb` and `ahgd_etl_notebook.py` work correctly with the refactored code.

### 4. How to Get Started

1.  **Set up Environment:** Clone the repo, create a virtual environment (`venv`), install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), and ensure `.env` points to your project's base directory.
2.  **Review `config.py`:** Understand the paths, URLs, and mappings. Start populating the missing parts.
3.  **Run Validation:** Execute `python run_etl.py --steps validate` and `python verify_surrogate_keys.py` to see the current errors.
4.  **Debug Failures:** Start tackling the validation errors, likely beginning with dimension generation and the joins in `process_census_table` or the refinement steps.
5.  **Run Tests:** Execute `pytest` frequently to ensure changes don't break existing functionality. Add new tests as you fix/refactor.
6.  **Execute Specific Steps:** Use `python run_etl.py --steps [step_name]` to test individual parts of the pipeline during development.
